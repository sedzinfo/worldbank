\usage{

\description{
Server-side logic for a Shiny web application that visualizes World Bank data using Plotly charts.
It includes interactive visualizations such as country comparisons, indicator trends, population pyramids,
bar plots, scatterplots, choropleth maps, and a searchable indicator index.
}
\details{
This server function includes:
\describe{
\item{\code{observeEvent}}{Synchronizes indicator options based on selected country/countries.}
\item{\code{renderPlotly}}{Generates interactive plots for each tab using Plotly:
\itemize{
\item Line plots for time-series indicator comparison
\item Animated population pyramids
\item Barplot rankings of countries by indicator
\item Animated choropleth maps of indicators
\item Animated scatterplots to show correlations
}}
\item{\code{renderDataTable}}{Generates an index of available indicators.}
}

Responsive behavior is handled by JavaScript listeners that capture browser dimensions for dynamic plot sizing.
Data filtering ensures complete cases are plotted, and animation frames are created based on year.
